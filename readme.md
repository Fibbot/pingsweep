been finding that i've needed to discover hosts on a subnet with machines that may or may not have typical enumeration tools already installed. 

especially cloud hosted networks with a large subnet full of hosts that change ip's daily.

to do:
- add windows functionality
- add ability to compile for os/arch instead of at runtime
- ... more than i can't currently think of
